# Hazri — working rules

These are the implementation rules from the PRD (`docs/PRD.md` §0). They apply
to every session in this repository.

1. **The design files are the visual spec, not code to port.**
   `design/html/NN-*.{light,dark}.html` are 390 x 844 CSS px = 390 x 844 dp.
   Match layout, spacing, radii, colours and type; build with Flutter widgets.
   `design/tokens.json` is the source of truth for colour, type and shape, and
   is mirrored in `lib/core/theme/`.
2. **Behaviour comes from the PRD.** Where a design and the PRD disagree, the
   PRD wins; note the conflict in the PR description.
3. **Never create, paraphrase, auto-translate or AI-generate Gurbani text,
   Gurbani audio, meanings, or images of the Gurus.** Every line of Gurbani and
   every meaning in the app comes from `content/source/` through
   `tools/content_pipeline/build_content_db.py`. Nothing Gurbani-related is
   typed into Dart.
4. **No ad SDKs, no login, no own server, no tracking SDKs.** This build makes
   no network requests at all; `INTERNET` is removed from the merged manifest.
5. **All UI strings are localised** in `pa`, `hi` and `en` from day one. No
   hard-coded user-facing strings; `test/core/l10n_test.dart` fails on a
   missing or untranslated key.
6. **Keep platform-specific code behind interfaces** so the iOS app in Phase 3
   needs new adapters, not rewrites (`HukamnamaSource`, `ReminderService`).
7. Every change ends with `flutter analyze` clean and `flutter test` passing.

## Regenerating

```bash
python3 tools/content_pipeline/build_content_db.py   # assets/content/content.db
flutter gen-l10n                                      # lib/core/l10n/gen
dart run build_runner build                           # drift *.g.dart
```

## Audio

Masters are **not** in git; they live on the `audio-masters` GitHub release.
See `audio/README.md` for how to fetch one, rebuild the shipping AAC, generate
timings and verify the alignment acoustically.

The paathi is deliberately uncredited: there is no name placeholder anywhere in
the app. Add the credit to `voice` in the content pipeline when one is agreed.

## Known gaps in this build

- **All nine banis now have text and a recitation.** Japji came from a
  schema-1.0 source file; the other eight are schema 2.0 and are loaded by
  `build_bani_v2()`. Daily Simran has its own recitation, which is not a bani
  and lives in `simran_track` rather than `audio_track`.
- **Meanings are not evenly covered.** Every bani has English and (bar Ardas)
  Punjabi; Hindi exists only for the four that are in Sri Guru Granth Sahib,
  because the Faridkot teeka covers that scripture alone. The reader shows
  what exists and nothing is machine-translated to fill a gap. Ardas has
  Punjabi for 9 of its 27 lines.
- **Schema-2.0 banis carry no section labels.** Their source files derive
  `unit` mechanically from the Gurmukhi numerals in the closing dandas and say
  outright that those are not editorial labels, so the unit number is stored
  and no word is invented for it. Japji keeps its labels because its source
  file names its sections.
- **Line timings are unverified** (`"verified": false`) for all nine banis.
  They are derived, not hand-checked; the PRD requires human verification
  before release (§8). `audio/README.md` has the measured state per bani and
  which to listen to first -- Rehras, where the check has power and found a
  real shortfall, then Jaap and Sukhmani, where the reciter runs lines
  together and the check cannot see anything at all.
- **The daily Hukamnama is gone**, replaced by ਅੱਜ ਦਾ ਵਿਚਾਰ (PRD 1.11): 200
  bundled lines from Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji, one a day by date, shareable as
  text or as an image. It needs no network, which is what the Hukamnama did
  need. The dataset carries no Ang numbers and the app does not invent one.
- **The Nanakshahi calendar covers 17 Aug - 15 Dec 2026 only**, derived from
  the supplied SGPC sample. Dates outside it report that rather than guessing.
